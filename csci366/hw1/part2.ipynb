    "1. Should we actually replace all words occuring once with <- unk -> token in the original corpus? Then wouldn't the count for this token be large? Or shall we just modify the frequency count by removing all the ones that only occur once?\n",
    "2. what do i do with random occurences like: <br>\n",
    "- Things with apostrophe get considered like its own token ('s) # my guess is yea, because this may add context for example ownership etc\n",
    "- Emails\n",
    "- dashes ( - )\n",
    "#### Questions Regarding Modeling \n",
    "1. when you say train a unigram mle, maximum mle, and bigram model w + 1 smoothing, does that mean for each sentence in test, we assign a probability to the entire sentence? Kinda like, x = sentence, y = prob of sentence? \n",
    "2. For the test data, we also replace token <= 1 to unk or just the freq count?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions regarding the report\n",
    "- what did you mean when you said, what sentence? the corpus used on ex 1?   <br>\n",
    "- 6. (20 points) Compute the perplexity of the sentence above under each of the models.\n",
