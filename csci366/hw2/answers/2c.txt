{fast, couple, shoot, fly}

Method: I added this file into the test case twice. One in the Test-action and one in the Test-comedy. My test set now contains 4 files. 
        The other 2 files are directly taken from the training data of each class to verify if I'm correctly predicting things using interpolation.

Where I made 2.txt of each class the test sentence {fast, couple, shoot, fly} and in both classes it predicted it to be action.
